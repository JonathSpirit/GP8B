GP8B V5.1 :
- GLOBAL
    - Small cleaning

- DOCUMENTS
    - Reverse changelog order (new version will be on the first line)

- SCHEMATICS
    - Better/More decoupling capacitor
    - Replacing old symbol for IC1 (CPLD)
    - Fixing the SPI 4bits only issue
    - ADDSCR_CLK was not sending the right pulses to the motherboard, this is due to
    old version without any standard in mind.

- PCB
    - J1 wasn't a male connector

- SCHEMATICS FEATURES
    - Now if the argument is not SRCVALUE, the processor will not go to the next address (1 byte in memory saved)
    on big program this improvement is not negligible.

    - Adding SN74AVC4T245D symbol
    - Set version to 5.0
    - Replacing all used 74x1Gxx symbols
        (shared power pin fix, and visual)

- PCB
    - Removing old footprints
    - Set version to 5.0
    - Adding QRCode with the Github link
    - Fixing 3D

- SCHEMATICS FEATURES
    - Replacing the old XC95288XL-10TQ144 by XC2C256-VQ100
        XC95288XL is a obsolete CPLD and is now replaced with
        a CoolRunnerII familly CPLD.
        the XC2C256-VQ100 is more hand-solder friendly too.

    - Adding the regulator TPS7A0518PDBZR for 1.8V (CPLD)
    - Adding VREF (3.3V) to the JTAG connector
    - Removing some unused pins and shrink the connector (J4) down
    - Adding a new connector for all the ALU pins (J5)
    - All capacitor for the CPLD is now 100nF
    - Adding SN74LVC8T245DW and SN74AVC4T245D to translate logic level for the CPLD

    - Renamed some connectors
    - SPI : now data come from the 8bits D-latch register (was directly controlled by the number bus)
    - Mounting holes is now on schematics

    - Renaming "OPC_CLK" to "OPCHOOSE_CLK"
    - Renaming "BCSPI_CLK" to "BCFG_SPI_CLK"

    - Renaming "Connecteur" sheet to "Connector" and "Connector.sch" to "fileConnector.sch"
    - Renaming "Registre" sheet to "Register" and "fileRegistre.sch" to "fileRegister.sch"
    - Renaming "Ram.sch" to "fileRAM.sch"
    - Renaming "SPI.sch" to "fileSPI.sch"

    - Apply the MM1 memory standard (3.3V I/O changes)


GP8B V4.0 :
    - Intial release
