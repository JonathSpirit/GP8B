- SCHEMATICS FEATURES
	- Replacing the old XC95288XL-10TQ144 by XC2C256-VQ100
		XC95288XL is a obsolete CPLD and is now replaced with
		a CoolRunnerII familly CPLD.
		the XC2C256-VQ100 is more hand-solder friendly too.
		
	- Adding the regulator TPS7A0518PDBZR for 1.8V (CPLD)
	- Removing some unused pins and shrink the connector (J4) down
	- Adding a new connector for all the ALU pins (J5)
	- All capacitor for the CPLD is now 100nF
	- Renamed some connectors
	- Adding VREF (3.3V) to the JTAG connector
	- Adding SN74LVC8T245DW and SN74AVC4T245D to translate logic level for the CPLD
	- Fix/Work-around for SPI (4bits only problem)
	- Mounting holes is now on schematics
